# Binary Operator Problems

Problems below:

1. Swaps: Figure out a way to swap two integers without defining a temp variable
2. Power2: Check if a number is a power of two
(I'll give a small hint for #2 - we can find the least significant bit of a number s using s & -s)
3. Odd? - Check if a number is odd using a single bitwise statement (this method is faster than using mod, btw!)
